Broadcast client for Assetto Corsa Competizione (pre 0.6) - project and source code.

IMPORTANT: It not work because Kunos temporarily disabled UDP broadcast protocol, i left here just in case someone want to look at my implementation of the client, when UDP Broadcasting will come back on ACC i will start a new project based on what i learned on develop this.
